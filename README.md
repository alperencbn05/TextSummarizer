Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we live and work in the modern world. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Deep learning, which uses neural networks inspired by the human brain, has achieved remarkable success in tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.
